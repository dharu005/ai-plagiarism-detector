# ai-plagiarism-detector
🤖AI-based Plagiarism detection and rewritting

## ⚡ Project Overview
This project aims to detect plagiarism in text documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
The system compares user input against a reference corpus and identifies plagiarized content based on similarity scores.

## 📚 Problem Statement
Plagiarism is a major concern in academics and content creation. Manual detection is time-consuming and unreliable. 
This project automates plagiarism detection using machine learning and NLP techniques.
